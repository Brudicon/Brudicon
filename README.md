My name is Ben Vigna!
I am a software engineer out of Michigan Tech, working as a software engineer for Firefly Integrations.

I want to code! I want to solve problems! And I'm always open to learning new things!

So, if you are recruiting, have a look! Though, I will admit, there is not much here these days.

If you like what you see, you can find me at bvig543@gmail.com.
