My name is Ben Vigna!
I am a new software engineer straight out of college. 

I love hiking, swimming, video games, and learning/teaching myself new programming languages. 

I am looking for a software engineering/developer position to give me experience in the field of software engineering. 

I want to code! I want to solve problems! And I'd also love to help people in the process. 

So, if you are recruiting, have a look! This is where my portfolio resides.

If you like what you see, you can find me at bavigna@mtu.edu.
